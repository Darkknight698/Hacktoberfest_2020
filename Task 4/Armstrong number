Question:

Let's write a java program to check whether the given number is armstrong number or not.

Armstrong Number in Java: A positive number is called armstrong number if it is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits for example 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 etc.

Let's try to understand why 153 is an Armstrong number.
153 = (1*1*1)+(5*5*5)+(3*3*3)  
where:  
(1*1*1)=1  
(5*5*5)=125  
(3*3*3)=27  
So:  
1+125+27=153
